# Path-Finder-Shortest-
This project is a Python-based application that finds the shortest path out of a maze using data structural algorithms. It offers an interface for maze creation, making it an essential tool for understanding algorithm behavior in various real world geo-spatial contexts such as leaving mazes.

## Features
Maze Creation:


Generate mazes of various sizes and complexities.


Allow manual maze creation and modification by the user.


Users can set start and end points, and add or remove obstacles.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
** Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted maze.
** Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores deeper paths first but does not guarantee the shortest path.
** Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path in weighted mazes and utilizes heuristics to optimize the search process for the shortest path.
